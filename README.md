A recreation of the original spiritsandsuch.com website, preserved from the Wayback Machine.

**Spirits and Such** is inspired by the fictional business from the popular anime and manga series *Mob Psycho 100*. In the series, "Spirits and Such Consultation Office" is run by the character Arataka Reigen, a self-proclaimed psychic who offers exorcism and spiritual consultation services. The original website captured the quirky, mysterious atmosphere of this fictional establishment.
