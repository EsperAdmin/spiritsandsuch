		<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Welcome to the second installment of the glorious psychic Reigen Arataka&#8217;s advice column–Ask Reigen! We have been absolutely flooded with requests from Reigen&#8217;s numerous fans! Thank you for your interest and support! I finally pulled Master Reigen away from his non-stop work to answer some more of your burning questions!</em></p>
<p><img src="Assets/2.jpg" alt="Reig"></noscript></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Our first question actually comes from a spirit by the name of SpiritzRule_02. They ask:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, so I&#8217;m a spirit. But I&#8217;m not harmful, I promise! But my jerk spirit roommate is. He is a nuisance whenever guests arrive. Always trying to scare them off and call them names that I can&#8217;t repeat to you. Do you think you can exorcise him out of my house so I can haunt in peace?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With love,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spirit who is lucky enough to have a computer and a café with free wifi next door</span></p>
<p><strong>Reigen: <b>Ah, what a benevolent fellow! I, Reigen Arataka, shall accept this job!</b></strong></p>
<p><em>Master Reigen closed his eyes in deep concentration and placed his hands together&#8230; a remote exorcism!! Suddenly his eyes popped open and a confident smirk crossed his face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reigen: Yeah, I can&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s too weak for me to see.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Our next question comes from Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last reigning Byzantine Emperor. Truly a client worthy of Master Reigen. He asks:</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">The Ottomans have arrived in Constantinople to fully siege it. How do I get rid of them so the Byzantine Empire doesn&#8217;t fall?</p>
<p><strong>Reigen: <b>Quit relying on those around you, old man. You’re making me sad here.</b></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Our last question comes from a former fellow-psychic named Alice Stone. She asks:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reigen-san, I lost my psychic powers yesterday. Before, I can teleport up to 100 km away. I can&#8217;t seem to do it today. Yesterday was also my 18th birthday. Is this a phase? Please help!</span></p>
<p><strong>Reigen: <b>You’re so addicted to your special powers, you’ve developed tunnel vision. Don’t get the wrong idea. No matter what kind of special powers they may be blessed with, people are still only human. Nothing more, and nothing less. If you want to make it big, you have to live in reality! That’s where you start.</b></strong></p>
<p><em>Truly, every word that falls from Master Reigen&#8217;s mouth is a glistening pearl of wisdom to be cherished. I hope Ms. Stone reflects upon his words, and I hope you all tune in next time for more words of advice from the 21st Century&#8217;s Greatest Psychic!</em></p>
